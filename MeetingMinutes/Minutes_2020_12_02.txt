Meeting with Marcel
Final meeting of the semester

We presented what we have.  Unfortunately, we missed the inital goal of a working prototype, but we did make significant progress
We have several working parts, just not a fully integrated platform
Marshalling works with a small subset of SPICE calls
Task distribution works in java, we just need to put the pieces together

Marcel seems happy with progress.

The team will not have offical meetings over the break, but we might do some individual work on the project to get the prototype working.
Hopefully we will have an integrated system at the start of next semester
