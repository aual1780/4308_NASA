Regular team meeting

Joel presents showstopper issue
- Our underlying assumptions about CSPICE are no longer sufficient.  We thought that *most* functions followed a similar call pattern, but we have found this to be untrue
- There are too many edge cases in the CSPICE functions
- We must take the time to evaluate all CSPICE functions and classify them by behavior type

- We have tasks that need to be sent to all workers (like furnish)
- We have tasks that need to be distributed via TDT algorithm (ie threaded)
- We have tasks that write to file instead of returning a value
- We have tasks that require local state changes in addition to the function being executed (surrogate pairs)

We are concerned with the DAF functions
- They modfy the kernel format (local state change)
- They require surrogate pair commands
- Possible solutions:
  - Full surrogate pair tracking
    - very difficult and time consuming
  - Add pair of tasks to output stream
    - This wont work bc tasks could be separated by batch boundaries
  - Run all tasks on Worker 0
    - This wont work because it would stall distributed "waves"
  - Run outside of ParSpice
    - possible, but messy
