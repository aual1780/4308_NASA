Meeting with Marcel

Plan for Marcel to write a publication quality paper re this project

We must plan for strong documentation of the project even if we don't finish all of the work
- Definitive doc should have intro, high level spec, low level details, use cases, and performance metrics

Make sure that decisions are included in design doc
- Must be in depth enough for Marcel to write a technical paper for possible publication

Performance Testing
- We still need to work on performance testing
- Our target has changed, so our demo and test are delayed, but we are still making strong progress
- Instead of focusing on a hand-made MVP, we have chosen to leverage the automation suite to generate the MVP
- This means that the MVP will not be available until the automation tools has been completed with the fully merged project components

Class video ideas
- Creating a video for this project will be difficult because it is a very technical developer tool
- We should focus on visualising the performance and multi-threaded operations instead of showing code
- @Marcel 
  - "There are many tools used by NASA that integrate geometric modeling from SPICE.  Unfortunately, these models are hindered by poor SPICE performance.  The single-threaded design is very slow.  parSpice is designed to fix the performance woes of the core tooling"
  

Joel cSPICE concerns
- rehash task stateful functions
  - file handlers
  - internal SPICE state modifications
  - cannot be run as part of distribution system

Options:
- run on worker0
- run in-proc (no distribution)

@Marcel
- Undecided, does not know enough about the functions to give an answer
- Currently leaning towards ignoring these special-case functions
- There is concern that these methods affect behvior for all other SPICE methods
  - If this is the case, we will need to globally apply the state modifications
