Team meeting

Demo/initial exe is now working, but it's slow
- Half of execution time is grpc message packing
- Not sure how we can improve the runtime
- We will attempt to optimize


Worker problems
- Must wait for workers to connect before proceeding with task processing
- Must make sure that workers shutdown with app
- Add dummy TCP connection so we can wait for workers to become responsive before sending requests


Testing
- Joe
- We will likely need to create manual tests for SPICE functions because we do not know valid argument sets
- Select testing subset (roughly 20ish funcs?)
