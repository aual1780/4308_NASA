Sponsor Meeting

Presented current performance metrics, 100x slower on very small jobs, 2x slower on medium jobs
- Marcel is pleased that the project now works, but obviously less than excited about the results
- Full profiling analysis is required
- We already know that 1/2 of runtime is gRPC packing/unpacking
- Test on expensive functions to see if the performance comparison is better
- Marcel has strongly encouraged us to find a solution to our perf issues.

Presentation:
- Change the focus from completed product to research project
- "We were assigned this research project, and were asked to determineg if there was a way to optimize CSPICE.  These are our results. [...] We dont think the desired performance goals are attainable with grpc, but we believe that [zeroMQ, shared memory, etc] could be an avenue for further research"
- Present perf metrics
- Plan for future work


Idea 1: 
multithread the gRPC packing to simply improve performance with existing design

Idea 2:
use zeromq

Idea 3:
Use gradle plugin to compile user execution pipeline into its own jar file to reduce arg passing

Idea 3b: 
Use gradle plugin to compile user arguments into jar files to completely bypass arg passing

Idea 4:
Use raw shared memory to pass args instead of gRPC/zeroMq

Idea 5:
burn it all down
