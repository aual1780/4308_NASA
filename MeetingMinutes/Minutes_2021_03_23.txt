Team meeting

Joel has presented a novel solution to our performance problems with a complete paradigm shift
- New object stream messaging strategy
- Scraps all of the previous project work of the last 6 months
- Very simple command model, does not require complex serialization
- Does not use gRPC
- Also does not require complex automation tooling
  - User are able to use the normal cSPICE workflow as-is
  
  Description
  - Users write their cSPICE pipeline as a worker process
  - User supplies input data from master process
  - master process streams input data to pipelined worker process
  - worker completes pipeline and returns final result
  
  Benefits
  - Only a single outbound request per task
  - Much faster than previous parSPICE work
  - Much faster than native cSPICE (unthreaded)
  
  Drawbacks
  - Potenetially complex setup
